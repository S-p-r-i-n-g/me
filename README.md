## Product Ethos

*The principles I bring to every team, every product, and every decision.*

**01. Check your ego at the door**
Product is a team sport—not a solo performance. Be here for the work, not the credit.

**02. Win because you want to, not because you have to**
Self-preservation shouldn't get you out of bed. Solving hard problems should.

**03. Debate like you mean it**
Dissent is welcome when it's driven by getting it right—not by being right.

**04. Stay curious, stay scrappy**
Think like a hacker. Resourcefulness beats resources every time.

**05. Never take "no" as the first answer**
Constraints are invitations to think differently. Push back, then push forward.

**06. Sometimes the best solution is low-tech**
Complexity isn't sophistication. Solve the problem, not the technology.

**07. Go positive, go first**
Assume good intent. Give grace. Reciprocity compounds.

**08. Own it—even when it's not yours**
The buck stops with you. Make decisions, stand behind them, fix what breaks.

**09. PMs are not mini-CEOs**
Lead with humility. Serve your team, your users, and your stakeholders—in that order.

**10. No one's too important to pick up a broom**
Do the hard work. Help each other. Win together.

**11. You don't know it until you do it**
The only way to truly understand a process is to live it—more than once.

**12. Embrace discomfort**
Most of this job is managing through uncertainty. Build that muscle. Ask for help.

**13. Know your "why"**
If you can't explain why you're doing something, you probably shouldn't be doing it.

**14. Start with the absurd**
Design thinking means giving yourself permission to explore before you converge.

**15. Anything worth doing is worth doing well**
Your work is your reputation. No task is too small to do right.
