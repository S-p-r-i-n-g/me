# Product Ethos

**The principles I bring to every team, every product, and every decision.**

I've been building products for 15 years. Along the way, I've learned that *how* you work matters as much as *what* you ship. These are the beliefs I carry into every room, every roadmap, and every hard conversation.

### 01. Check your ego at the door
Product is a team sport—not a solo performance. Be here for the work, not the credit.

### 02. Win because you want to, not because you have to
Self-preservation shouldn't get you out of bed. Solving hard problems should.

### 03. Debate like you mean it
Dissent is welcome when it's driven by getting it right—not by being right.

### 04. Stay curious, stay scrappy
Think like a hacker. Resourcefulness beats resources every time.

### 05. Never take "no" as the first answer
Constraints are invitations to think differently. Push back, then push forward.

### 06. Sometimes the best solution is low-tech
Complexity isn't sophistication. Solve the problem, not the technology.

### 07. Go positive, go first
Assume good intent. Give grace. Reciprocity compounds.

### 08. Own it—even when it's not yours
The buck stops with you. Make decisions, stand behind them, fix what breaks.

### 09. PMs are not mini-CEOs
Lead with humility. Serve your team, your users, and your stakeholders—in that order.

### 10. No one's too important to pick up a broom
Do the hard work. Help each other. Win together.

### 11. You don't know it until you do it
The only way to truly understand a process is to live it—more than once.

### 12. Embrace discomfort
Most of this job is managing through uncertainty. Build that muscle. Ask for help.

### 13. Know your "why"
If you can't explain why you're doing something, you probably shouldn't be doing it.

### 14. Start with the absurd
Design thinking means giving yourself permission to explore before you converge.

### 15. Anything worth doing is worth doing well
Your work is your reputation. No task is too small to do right.

*Ship with conviction.*
